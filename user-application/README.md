## Installation

This project is created with `npx create-react-app 'project-name'`
https://reactjs.org/ 

To run a test server, make sure you have Node.js and npm on your device
https://nodejs.org/en/

After repo is cloned, first navigate to `user-application`.

Install requisites with `npm install` in the VSCode terminal.
Run server with `npm start` in the VSCode integrated terminal.
If you only want to start the front-end, use `npm run website`.
To connect the backend, start a new terminal of your choice and navigate to \sahlest-emilsjol-nodelius-project\go-backend and enter `go run .` in your terminal.

If you're on windows, you can accomplish both at the same time by running `./server.bat` while in the user-application directory.

The page will reload if you make edits.

To exit, use `ctrl + c` in both terminals.
